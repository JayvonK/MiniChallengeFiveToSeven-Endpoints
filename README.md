MiniChallengeFiveToSeven - Endpoints
Creating 4 enpoints(Mad Lib, Odd or Even and two reverse its), where it takes in the user's input(s) and displays a result based off of endpoint. And each endpoint has it's own controller, and services file.

Peer Reviewed: Everything works well. All data validation works and correct errors are given. Story is mad crazy too. 
Only nitpicky critique that I have would be that I would name the functions a name that isn't too close to the name of the controller itself for orginization purpose.
